  <!-- 
    Shows active Tasks and Bugs together so that they can be ranked.
    Shows the unranked ones first, starting with those not assigned to an iteration. 
    Then the Bugs and Tasks that have been ranked.
    So in a triage meeting, your task is to assess the ones at the top of the list
    and give them ranks, fitting them in between the existing ones.
